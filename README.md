# vk_api

This repository contains my old experiments with vk api. Some of them are done, and some are not. 
My main and the only real need were to back up some large (and important to me) dialogs from vk to my local hd. And I've succeed (see the **Выгрузка (и мб отправка) сообщений.ipynb** )

It is highly possible I'll never back to this workflow, 'cause I've already satisfied my own lust to curiosity with this code.
